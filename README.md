### Tute 02
01). University of Kelaniya conducted a coding competition, and each student's performance was evaluated based on two rounds: Round 1 and Round 2. The student data is represented in the
following format. Answer the following questions using List data structure.

##### Student Round 1 Round 2
##### A       95       90
##### B       78       85
##### C       85       88

##### E       72       80
##### F       88       92

a. Insert the provided data into the list and print the details as above.

b. Who is the top scorer in Round 1?

c. Who W is the top scorer in Round 2?

d. Implement a method named 'DisplayImprovedScores' that takes the list of students as input and displays the names of students who improved their scores from Round 1 to Round 2.

e. Determine the student who will be awarded the ‘Coding Champion title’. This title goes to the student with the highest combined score (Round 1 + Round 2).

02) Write a program using List data structure to find the mean, median, mode and range of theuser given dataset.
   
Example: 10, 9, 52, 24, 35, 11, 9, 12, 3, 11, 25, 24, 8, 11, 42
